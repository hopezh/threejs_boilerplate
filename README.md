> `main.js` is the entry point for our JavaScript application, and we’ll fill it up in the next chapter. The `type="module"` attribute tells the browser we’re writing JavaScript modules. If this is new to you, head over to **[A.4: JavaScript Modules](https://discoverthreejs.com/book/appendix/javascript-modules/)**, which has everything you need to know about JavaScript modules to follow the code in this book.
